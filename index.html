<h2>An ordered HTML list</h2>

  <!--the list started with a closed ul tag and ends with an ol closing tag which makes it Incorrect I just replace them with proper ul tags for opening and closing-->
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>  
<h2>An unordered HTML list</h2>

  <!--the li opening tags were written incorrectly for the first and last one as the first does not have one while the third one was misspelled not just on the opening but also on the closing tags and did l1 instead of li so I fixed them and made sure they were all using li properly-->
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
